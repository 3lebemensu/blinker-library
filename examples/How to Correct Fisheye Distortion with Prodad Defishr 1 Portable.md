## Tips for Fisheye Distortion Correction
 
Here are some tips that can help you get better results when correcting fisheye distortion:

- Choose the right type of fisheye lens for your purpose. There are different types of fisheye lenses that have different projection mappings and focal functions. Some of them are rectilinear, stereographic, equidistant, equisolid angle, or orthographic[^1^]. Depending on the type of lens, you may get different levels of distortion and field of view.
- Use a high-quality fisheye lens that has minimal chromatic aberration, vignetting, and flare. These optical defects can affect the quality of your image and make it harder to correct the distortion.
- Use a tripod or a stabilizer when shooting with a fisheye lens. This can help you avoid camera shake and motion blur that can also degrade your image quality.
- Align your camera with the horizon as much as possible when shooting with a fisheye lens. This can reduce the curvature of the horizon and make it easier to correct later.
- Use Prodad Defishr 1 Portable's exclusive camera calibration tool to create a custom profile for your camera and lens combination. This can improve the accuracy and quality of the distortion correction.

By following these tips, you can make the most out of your fisheye lens and correct its distortion effectively with Prodad Defishr 1 Portable.
