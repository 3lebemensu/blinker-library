If you want to run Mac OS X on your PC, but you don't have a Mac computer, you can use a method called iBoot + MultiBeast. This method is designed and tested for any desktop or laptop running the latest line of Intel processors, the Core i3/i5/i7s. You will need a copy of Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6, a blank CD, and a USB drive with at least 8 GB of space.

In this article, we will show you how to install Mac OS X Snow Leopard on a PC with iBoot and MultiBeast, using an ASUS P7P55D motherboard as an example. You can follow the same steps for other compatible motherboards, but you may need to adjust some settings or drivers accordingly.
 
## Step 1: Download iBoot and MultiBeast
 
The first thing you need to do is to download iBoot and MultiBeast from the tonymacx86 website[^1^]. iBoot is a bootable CD that allows you to boot into Mac OS X installation disc. MultiBeast is a post-installation tool that helps you configure your system and install drivers.
 
You will need to register an account on the tonymacx86 website to download these files. After you download them, burn iBoot onto a blank CD using any CD burning software. You can also use a USB drive instead of a CD, but you will need to use a tool like TransMac to make it bootable.
 
## Step 2: Prepare the USB drive
 
The next thing you need to do is to prepare the USB drive with Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6 installation files. You can use either a retail DVD or a downloaded ISO file of Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6. If you use a DVD, you will need to use a tool like UltraISO or PowerISO to extract the files to your USB drive. If you use an ISO file, you can simply copy it to your USB drive.
 
After you copy the files to your USB drive, you will need to rename the file called "mach\_kernel" to "mach\_kernel.old". This is because iBoot uses a modified kernel that is compatible with most PCs. You will also need to delete the file called "boot.efi" from the System/Library/CoreServices folder on your USB drive. This is because iBoot uses its own bootloader that can load Mac OS X on PCs.
 
## Step 3: Boot into iBoot
 
Now you are ready to boot into iBoot and start the installation process. Insert the iBoot CD (or USB drive) into your PC and restart it. Make sure you set your BIOS to boot from the CD (or USB) first. You should see a screen like this:

At this point, you can eject the iBoot CD (or USB) and insert the USB drive with Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6 files. Then press F5 to refresh the screen. You should see an icon of Mac OS X installation disc like this:

Select this icon and press Enter to boot into Mac OS X installation disc.
 
## Step 4: Install Mac OS X Snow Leopard
 
Once you boot into Mac OS X installation disc, you will see a welcome screen like this:

Before you proceed with the installation, you need to format your hard drive for Mac OS X. To do this, go to Utilities > Disk Utility from the menu bar. Select your hard drive from the
